## Feedback on projects
### Scalablity
- Why are we focussing on this?
  - DB depot contains :
    - All the raw and consolidated events generated by all telematics devices.
    - The domain model for the devices and clients.
    - Plans and features.
  - Daily consolidation runs per timezone on the database (via PL/SQL scripts) to reduce the data to make it easier to access.
  - Because of all of this we are running out of space (even on the biggest physical ec2 instance we can get).
  - Not Scalable in the long term.
- Consolidation v2
    - Move logic from pl/sql scripts on the database to java on lambda.
    - Move from PostgreSQL as source to CentralEvent Dynamo DB database.
    - Test and tweak
        - Out-Of-Memory issues on consolidation when run from more than 7 days back
- Backport
    - Aims to facilitate the migration process for systems by providing Consolidation V2 data as Consolidation V1 style
