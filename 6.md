## Feedback on projects
### Upgrade event-api component tests
- Event api component test executed by deploying a stack to Sandbox env and then executing test.
- Mark and Andrew reworked tests to use localstack, docker and MockWebserver to run locally.
- Tests now executes quicker and stabler and are easier to expand and modify.
